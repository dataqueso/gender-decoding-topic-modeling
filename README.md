## Steps

1. Get the U.S. Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey 2020 (16 yrs or older) dataset
2. Run the `get_job_titles.py` to get the top 100 job titles for female and male.
3. Run the `scrape_jds_by_title.py` to get job adverts for those job titles from the female and male lists.
